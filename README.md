Hey, guys what's up. This is a `MERN` stack `WOMEN PARLOUR` project. I'm using much more technology in this project. I used React JS and Tailwindcss for the frontend and the server-side used express js. For this project, I used MongoDB on the database. Payment gateway integration for used Stripe. I also used Firebase for the authentication system implementation. This is a very interesting mern-stack project. so you're live preview see.

1. Used technologies for this project `Tailwind Css`, `React`, `Express`, `MongoDB`, `Firebase`, `Stripe`, `SweetAlert2`, `React Query`, `React Hook Form`, and much more.

2. Users can purchase a service and it will be shown on the dashboard order page. Or the user may pay for the service. Must be a user login to purchase the service.
3. A user can give a review. This review shows the home page.

4. An admin may want to add a service, manage all orders, manage services.
